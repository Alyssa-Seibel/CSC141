If I had infinate programing skills im not sure what I would build. Having a large variety is actually harder for me to choose from than a small variety. 

Some things I do want to learn to create is my own website. I have been working my way up to selling my jewelry so id love to learn how to make my own website. I also would like to create a portfolio for my jewelry. Lastly, i would like to code more games. I really enjoyed the Papa's games, so I want to make a game that could be similar to them.
