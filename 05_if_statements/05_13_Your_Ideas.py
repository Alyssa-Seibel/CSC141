This chapter has opened a lot of doors for me and ideas for me to make.
I want to try and code resurant data and easy inputs games
I learned a little bit about input data for HTML, but it is nothing compared to what Python taught me.
So, I want to continue on the knowledge I learned from HTML and transfer it on to Python. Then I will create
more restaurant data.
