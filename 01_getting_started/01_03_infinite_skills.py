If I had infinite programing skills, I’m not sure what I would build. 
Having a large variety is harder for me to choose from than a small variety. 

Things I do want to learn to create is my own website. 
I have been working my way up to selling my jewelry, so I’d love to learn how to make my own website.
I also would like to create a portfolio for my jewelry. Lastly, I would like to code more games.
I really enjoyed the “Papa’s” games, so I want to make a game that could be like them.
