'''
From Pep I learned that spaces are preferred indentation instead of tabs.
I also learned that there are character limits (79)
Blank lines should be used sparingly
Imports should be used in seperate lines
Avoid whitespace 
    some examples are within parentheses/brackets/braces, following commas near parentheses, and before or after commas/semicolon/or colons
